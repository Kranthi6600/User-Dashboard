# User Dashboard UI

This is a **simple user dashboard interface** built for practice purposes. I created this project with the help of **ChatGPT** to improve my skills in frontend development and UI design.

## 🚀 What I Learned
- Basic layout structuring using HTML and CSS
- Flexbox and grid positioning
- Dashboard component breakdown
- Clean code practices
- Using AI (ChatGPT) to assist in learning and building

## 📌 Purpose
This is not a production-grade project. It was built purely for **learning and practicing front-end skills**. I believe that repeating and improving small UI projects like this will help me grow faster as a developer.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com) as assistant and co-builder


## 💡 Notes
- This project was built as part of my daily practice routine.
- All UI/UX logic and code were implemented step-by-step by me with the guidance of ChatGPT.
- This dashboard might be updated or rebuilt in React or other frameworks as I continue learning.
